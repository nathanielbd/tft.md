# ability
starts spinning his axe, causing his next [[basic attack]] to gain 150 / 200 / 500 (xAP) and (+150 / 160 / 400% [[attack damage]]) bonus [[physical damage]]

the spinning axe ricochets off the target high up into the air, landing 2 seconds later at Draven's current position

if Draven catches an axe, *Spinning Axe* is reapplied for no additional cost on his next basic attack

Draven can hold up to two *Spinning Axes* in his hands at once

**VIP bonus**: gains infinite attack range and ignores 50% of target's [[armor]]
