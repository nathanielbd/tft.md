# ability
rides her rocket into the sky, then comes crashing down near the center-most enemy, dealing 450 / 650 / 8888 (xAP) magic damage to enemies around the epicenter and 50% to all other enemies in a large area

the epicenter burns every unit except her for 5 seconds, dealing 2 / 3 / 4% of the target's maximum health ([[target-max-health]]) each second as [[true damage]] and applying [[grievous wounds]] for the duration

she then swaps to her rocket launcher for the rest of combat, causing her [[basic attack]]s to explode for 220 / 230 / 888% [[attack damage]] [[physical damage]] in a small area around her target
