gain a treasure chest that opens when you win combat against a player

at the start of each planning phase, roll the dice to add more loot to the chest

the longer you've gone without opening the chest, the luckier the dice

3 mercenaries: roll 2 dice

5 mercenaries: the dice are even luckier (there are 5 mercenary champions this set, emblem cannot be crafted)

7 mercenaries: upon winning, roll a 3rd dice that grants bonus loot
