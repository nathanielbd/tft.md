# ability
devours his target, storing them in his belly and dealing 1000 / 1500 / 30000 (xAP) magic damage over 3 seconds

during this time, the target is invulnerable to other sources of damage and he gains 30% damage reduction

if they die while inside, he eiter spits out a random item component they were holding, or the cost of the unit in gold

otherwise, he spits them towards the farthest enemy, briefly [[stun]]ning targets they impact

if the target is immune to crowd control, they take 35% damage instead
